# Lynxion Engineering Progress Ledger

## Current goal

Establish a statistically defensible, cost-adjusted trading edge while preserving execution
correctness, experimental validity, and VST risk controls.

## Current task

Implement the frozen C-05 cross-sectional momentum evaluator after all four initial strategy
candidates failed the robust OOS promotion gate.

## Status

TASK 000 operational closure and TASK 001/002 attribution are complete. Controlled edge
research remains in progress; C-01 through C-04 are rejected and production strategy logic is
unchanged.

## Latest verified findings

- Generic profit-lock behavior was observed after runtime reload on ETHUSDT and BNBUSDT:
  their exchange-side stops moved beyond entry in the profitable direction without manual or
  symbol-specific intervention.
- The manager now waits for broker-side order visibility before local success, starts its loop
  after `is_running` is set, isolates broker failures, prioritizes BingX VST, and hydrates the
  exchange stop after a restart.
- Latest read-only VST coverage check: 10 open positions, each with one exchange-side
  `STOP_MARKET` and one `TAKE_PROFIT_MARKET` order. Coverage is not treated as proof of
  a profit lock.
- Final entry admission now reads authoritative BingX positions and atomically enforces
  capacity, duplicate-symbol, exposure, cooldown, order-risk, and stop requirements at the
  broker boundary. A dry live check failed closed at the configured 10-position capacity.

## Changes made

- `8c09624` verify pending exchange stops before local success.
- `43afd7b` start background protection loops reliably.
- `8cd80e1` isolate non-primary broker failures.
- `25d069f` prioritize BingX VST protection checks.
- `f649444` hydrate existing exchange stops after restart.
- `700c748` enforce dynamic blacklist at the final broker boundary.
- `b7cc9c3` keep the empty-opportunity loop idle-safe.
- `7418c7d` enforce broker-backed final entry risk admission.

## Test evidence

- Focused active-position regression tests: 11 passed after the restart-hydration correction.
- Full post-correction suite: 622 passed, 1 optional layering test skipped
  (`import-linter` is not installed locally). This includes 461 unit, 109
  characterization/contract, and 52 smoke/E2E tests.
- Final TASK-0092 suite: 637 passed, 1 optional layering test skipped; this includes four
  focused C-01/C-02/C-03 evaluator regressions.

## Rejected hypotheses

- Higher win rate alone is not evidence of an edge.
- Adding new strategies, ML, or capital scaling before attribution/OOS evidence is not justified.
- C-04 VWAP reversal: all four folds, all symbols, and both sides were negative after costs.
- C-01 trend BUY and C-03 volatility breakout: negative aggregate expectancy and failed
  stability gates.
- C-02 trend SELL: positive aggregate expectancy (+0.5389%, N=17) but insufficient fold
  samples, negative BTC expectancy, and ETH dependence; rejected for robustness.

## Open risks

- The current historical files do not provide point-in-time funding or bid/ask observations;
  frozen cost assumptions must remain explicit.
- Initial candidates have small samples under path-dependent execution; positive-looking narrow
  cells cannot be promoted without robust OOS support.
- Existing project-context documents outside the active task/ledger may contain stale claims.

## Next task

Evaluate preregistered C-05 cross-sectional relative strength/weakness using a dynamic liquid
universe and broad-market median context. Stored BTC history overlaps the broad universe for
only about one day, so unavailable BTC context is not fabricated. LONG/SHORT separation,
realistic costs, confidence bounds, portfolio limits, and NO TRADE remain mandatory.

## Operator decision required

The operator granted standing authorization on 2026-08-29 for ordinary engineering/research,
verified commits, and controlled VST/paper runtime reloads after pre/post protection checks.
Real funds, secrets, destructive/data-loss operations, security-boundary changes, paid services,
legal/compliance decisions, and irreversible choices remain separately approval-gated.
